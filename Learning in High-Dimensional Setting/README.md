# Learning in High Dimensional Setting: Low Sample Size Problem & Curse of Dimensionality

Our example for Low Sample Size Problem is eigenface embedding. The ORL Face dataset from AT&T Cambridge is used which can be found publicly [here](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html).

See their paper for more info.

For Curse of Dimensionality, we use python to create mock data and inspect the problem from different points of view.
